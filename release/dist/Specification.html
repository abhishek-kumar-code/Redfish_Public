<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API (&quot;Redfish&quot;) is a new interface that uses RESTful interface semantics to access data defined in model format to perform out of band systems management.  It is suitable for a wide range of servers, from stand-alone servers to rack mount and bladed environments but scales equally well for large scale cloud environments.</p>
<p>There are several out of band systems management standards (defacto and de jour) available in the industry.  They all either vary widely in implementation, were developed for single server embedded environments or have their roots in antiquated software modeling constructs.  There is no single industry standard that is simple to use, based on emerging programming standards, embedded friendly and capable of meeting large scale data center &amp; cloud needs.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Redfish Scalable Platform Management API (&quot;Redfish&quot;) is a management standard using a data model representation inside of a hypermedia RESTful interface.  Because it is based on REST, Redfish is easier to use and implement than many other solutions.  Since it is model oriented, it is capable of expressing the relationships between components in modern systems as well as the semantics of the services and components within them.  It is also easily extensible.  By using a hypermedia approach to REST, Redfish can express a large variety of systems from multiple vendors.  By requiring JSON representation, a wide variety of resources can be created in a denormalized fashion not only to improve scalability, but the payload can be easily interpreted by most programming environments as well as being relatively intuitive for a human examining the data.  The model is exposed in terms of an interoperable OData Schema, with the payload of the messages being expressed in JSON following OData JSON conventions. The schema (available in both XML and JSON formats) includes annotations to facilitate automatic translation of the schema to JSON Schema. The ability to externally host the Schema definition of the resources in a machine-readable format allows the meta data to be associated with the data without encumbering Redfish services with the meta data, thus enabling more advanced client scenarios as found in many data center and cloud environments.    </p>
<h3 id="principal-goals-scope">Principal Goals &amp; Scope</h3>
<p>There are many principles and goals of Redfish as an architecture, a protocol and a data representation.  It is intended that this architecture support a wide variety of systems found in service today - from stand alone machines to racks of equipment found in cloud service environment. Extensibility is a key goal, as is forward compatibility and deterministic behavior.  Leveraging the protocols and standards widely accepted and used in environments today is a key strategy to achieve these goals.  Simplicity to the extent possible is another goal, achieved by making as few operations and as few instances as possible in the model. Matching the programming environments that are being widely adopted today is another goal. </p>
<p>The following design tenets govern the design of the Redfish Scalable Platform Management API, with the key goals elaborated below:</p>
<ul>
<li>RESTful interface using a JSON payload and entity data model</li>
<li>Separation of protocol from data model, allowing them to be revised independently</li>
<li>Specified versioning rules for protocol and schema</li>
<li>Leverage strength of internet protocol standards where it meets architectural requirements, such as JSON, HTTP, OData, and the RFCs referenced by this document.</li>
<li>Focused on scalable environments but capable of managing current server environments</li>
<li>Focus on out-of-band access -- implementable on existing BMC and firmware products</li>
<li>Present value-add features alongside standardized items</li>
<li>Functionality must be usable by non-computer-science professionals</li>
<li>Data definitions as obvious in context as possible</li>
<li>Opaque view of implementation architecture</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rest-based">REST based</h4>
<p>This document defines a RESTful interface. Many service applications are exposed RESTful interfaces. </p>
<p>There are several reasons to define a RESTful interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>It enables a light weight implementation, where economy is a necessity (smaller data transmitted than SOAP, fewer layers to the protocol than WS-Man).</li>
<li>It is on a trajectory to become a prevalent access method in the industry.</li>
<li>It is easy to learn and easy to document.</li>
<li>There are a number of toolkits &amp; development environments that can be used for REST.</li>
<li>It supports data model semantics and maps easily to the common CRUD operations.</li>
<li>It fits with our design principle of simplicity.</li>
<li>It is equally applicable to software application space as it is for embedded environments thus enabling convergence and sharing of code of components within the management ecosystem.</li>
<li>It is schema agnostic so adapts well to any modeling language.</li>
<li>By using it, Redfish can leverage existing security &amp; discovery mechanisms in the industry. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="follow-odata-conventions">Follow OData Conventions</h4>
<p>With the popularity of RESTful APIs, there are nearly as many RESTful interfaces as there are applications. While following REST patterns helps promote good practices, due to design differences between the many RESTful APIs there is no interoperability between them.</p>
<p>OData defines a set of common RESTful conventions and markup which, if adopted, provides for interoperability between APIs.</p>
<p>Adopting OData conventions for describing schema, url conventions, and naming and structure of common properties in a JSON payload, not only encapsulate best practices for RESTful APIs but further enables Redfish services to be consumed by a growing ecosystem of generic client libraries, applications, and tools.</p>
<h4 id="model-oriented">Model Oriented</h4>
<p>Bitwise prior solutions (like IPMI) have difficulty showing relationships.  Model orientation solves this.  But current models that have evolved over time have become extremely complex, requiring many IOs to gather information.  For that reason, as well as the complexity of their protocols and operations, they have received little implementation attention.  Some have their roots in modeling multiple domains (printers, switches, software, etc).  Additionally the expression of meta data in those models have only been adopted by niche markets.   </p>
<p>The Redfish model is built for managing systems. All resources are defined in OData Schema and represented in JSON format. OData is an industry standard that encapsulates best practices for RESTful services and provides interoperability across services of different types. JSON is being widely adopted in multiple disciplines and has a large number of tools and programming languages that accelerate development when adopting these approaches. </p>
<h4 id="separation-of-protocol-from-data-model">Separation of Protocol from Data Model</h4>
<p>The protocol operations are specified independently of the data model.  The protocol is also versioned independently of the data model.  The expectation is that the protocol version changes extremely infrequently, while the data model version is allowed to change as needed.  This implies that innovation should happen primarily in the data model, not the protocol.  It allows the data model to be extended and changed as needed without requiring the protocol or API version to change.</p>
<h4 id="hypermedia-api-service-endpoint">Hypermedia API Service Endpoint</h4>
<p>Like other hypermedia APIs, Redfish has a single service endpoint URI and all other resources are accessible via opaque URIs referenced from the root.  Any resource discovered through links found by accessing the root service or any service or resource referenced using references from the root service will conform to the same version of the protocol supported by the root service. </p>
<p>Note that the ServiceRoot Schema places requirements on the last segment of the path for the URIs discoverable through the service root. </p>
<h4 id="scope">Scope</h4>
<p>The scope of this specification is to define the next generation systems management interface.  This includes defining both the protocol and data model, as well as other architectural components needed for systems management environments.</p>
<p>Specifically, this document is intended to enable an open, industry-standard solution as proprietary or single-vendor efforts are not acceptable for target audience.  The focus is on out-of-band access for large scale environments, though this architecture is capable of being the architectural successor to many of the current management standards.  </p>
<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>
<p>Redfish does not guarantee that client software will never need to be updated.  Examples that may require updates include accommodation of new types of systems or their components, data model updates, and so on.  System optimization for an application will always require architectural oversight.  However, Redfish does attempt to minimize instances of forced upgrades to clients using Schemas, strict versioning and forward compatibility rules and through separation of the protocol from the data model.</p>
<p>Redfish does not enable a client to read a Resource Tree and write it to another Redfish Service.  This is not possible as it is a hypermedia API. Only the root object has a well known URI. The resource topology reflects the topology of the system and devices it represents.  Consequently, different server or device types will result in differently shaped resource trees, potentially even for identical systems from the same manufacturer. </p>
<p>Additionally, not all Redfish resources are simple read/write resources.  Implementations may follow other interaction patterns discussed later.  As an example, user credentials or certificates cannot simply be read from one service and transplanted to another.  Another example is the use of Setting Data instead of writing to the same resource that was read from.</p>
<p>There is no raw/pass-thru interface as part of the standard.</p>
<h3 id="service-elements">Service Elements</h3>
<h4 id="synchronous-and-asynchronous-operation-support">Synchronous and Asynchronous Operation Support</h4>
<p>While the majority of operations in this architecture are synchronous in nature, some operations can take a long time to execute, more time than a client typically wants to wait. For this reason, some operations can be asynchronous at the discretion of the service. The request portion of an asynchronous operation is no different from the request portion of a synchronous operation.</p>
<p>The use of HTTP Response codes enable a client to determine if the operation was completed synchronously or asynchronously.  For more information see the section on <a href="#task">Tasks</a>.</p>
<h4 id="eventing-mechanism">Eventing Mechanism</h4>
<p>In some situations it is useful for a service to provide messages to clients that fall outside the normal request/response paradigm. These messages, called events, are used by the service to asynchronously notify the client of some significant state change or error condition, usually of a time critical nature.</p>
<p>Only one style of eventing is currently defined by this specification - push style eventing. In push style eventing, when the server detects the need to send an event, it uses an HTTP POST to push the event message to the client.  Clients can subscribe to the eventing service to enable reception of events by creating a ListenerDestination subscription entry in the Event Service, or an administrator can create subscriptions as part of the Redfish service configuration.  All subscriptions are persistent configuration settings. </p>
<p>Events originate from a specific resource. Not all resources are able to generate events. Those resources capable of generating events might not generate any events unless a subscription has been created to listen for the event. An administrator or client creates a subscription by sending a &quot;subscribe&quot; message to the Event Service. A subscribe message is sent using HTTP POST to the Event Subscriptions collection.</p>
<p>The Section on <a href="#eventing">Eventing</a> further in this specification discusses the details of the eventing mechanism.</p>
<h4 id="actions">Actions</h4>
<p>Operations can be divided into two sets: intrinsic and extrinsic.  Intrinsic operations, often referred to as CRUD, are mapped to <a href="#methods">HTTP methods</a>.  The protocol also has the ability to support extrinsic operations -- those operations that do not map easily to CRUD.  Examples of extrinsic would be items that collectively would be better performed if done as a set (for scalability, ease of interface, server side semantic preservation or similar reasons) or operations that have no natural mapping to CRUD operations. One examples is system reset.  It is possible to combine multiple operations into a single action.  A system reset could be modeled as an update to state, but semantically the client is actually requesting a state change and not simply changing the value in the state.</p>
<p>In Redfish, these extrinsic operations are called <strong>actions</strong> and are discussed in detail in different parts of this specification.</p>
<p>The Redfish Schema defines certain standard actions associated with <a href="#common-Redfish-resources">common Redfish resources</a>.  For these standard actions, the Redfish Schema contains the normative language on the behavior of the action.  OEM extensions are also allowed to the <a href="#schema-extensibility">schema</a>, including defining <a href="#custom-actions">actions</a> for existing resources.</p>
<h4 id="service-entry-point-discovery">Service Entry Point Discovery</h4>
<p>While the service itself is at a well-known URI, the service host must be discovered. Redfish, like UPnP, uses SSDP for discovery. SSDP is supported in a wide variety of devices, such as printers.  It is simple, lightweight, IPv6 capable and suitable for implementation in embedded environments.  Redfish is investigating additional service entry point discovery (e.g. DHCP-based) approaches.</p>
<p>For more information, see the section on <a href="#discovery-1">Discovery</a></p>
<h4 id="remote-access-support">Remote Access Support</h4>
<p>A wide variety of remote access and redirection services are supported in this architecture.  Critical to out-of-band environments are mechanisms to support Serial Console access, Keyboard Video and Mouse re-direction (KVM-IP), Command Shell (i.e. Command Line interface) and remote Virtual Media.  Support for Serial Console, Command Shell, KVM-IP and Virtual Media are all encompassed in this standard and are expressed in the Redfish Schema.  This standard does not define the protocols or access mechanisms for accessing those devices and services.  The Redfish Schema provides for the representation and configuration of those services, establishment of connections to enable those services and the operational status of those services.  However, the specification of the protocols themselves are outside the scope of this specification.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>The challenge with security in a remote interface that is programmatic is to ensure both the interfaces used to interact with Redfish and the data being exchanged are secured. This means designing the proper security control mechanisms around the interfaces and securing the channels used to exchange the data. As part of this, specific behaviors are to be put in place including defining and using minimum levels of encryption for communication channels etc.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-details">Protocol Details</h2>
<p>The Redfish Scalable Platform Management API is based on REST and follows OData conventions for interoperability, as defined in <a href="#OData-Protocol">OData-Protocol</a>, JSON payloads, as defined in <a href="#OData-JSON">OData-JSON</a>, and a machine-readable representation of schema, as defined in <a href="#OData-CSDL">OData-Schema</a>. The schemas include annotations to enable direct translation to JSON Schema for validation and consumption by tools supporting JSON Schema. Following these common standards and conventions increases interoperability and enables leveraging of existing tool chains.</p>
<p>Redfish follows the OData minimal conformance level for clients consuming minimal metadata.</p>
<p>Throughout this document, we refer to Redfish as having a protocol mapped to a data model.  More accurately, HTTP is the application protocol that will be used to transport the messages and TCP/IP is the transport protocol. The RESTful interface is a mapping to the message protocol.  For simplicity though, we will refer to the RESTful mapping to HTTP, TCP/IP and other protocol, transport and messaging layer aspects as the Redfish protocol. </p>
<p>The Redfish protocol is designed around a web service based interface model, and designed for network and interaction efficiency for both user interface (UI) and automation usage. The interface is specifically designed around the REST pattern semantics.</p>
<p><a href="#http-methods">HTTP methods</a> are used by the Redfish protocol for common CRUD operations and to retrieve header information.</p>
<p><a href="#actions">Actions</a> are used for expanding operations beyond CRUD type operations, but should be limited in use.</p>
<p><a href="#media-types">Media types</a> are used to negotiate the type of data that is being sent in the body of a message. </p>
<p><a href="#status-codes">HTTP status codes</a> are used to indicate the server&#39;s attempt at processing the request.  <a href="#error-response">Extended error handling</a> is used to return more information than the HTTP error code provides.</p>
<p>The ability to send secure messages is important; the <a href="#security">Security</a> section of this document describes specific TLS requirements.</p>
<p>Some operations may take longer than required for synchronous return semantics. Consequently, deterministic <a href="#synchronous-and-asynchronous-operation-support">asynchronous semantic</a> are included in the architecture.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-http">Use of HTTP</h3>
<p>HTTP is ideally suited to a RESTful interface. This section describes how HTTP is used in the Redfish interface and what constraints are added on top of HTTP to assure interoperability of Redfish compliant implementations.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Redfish interface shall be exposed through a web service endpoint implemented using Hypertext Transfer Protocols, version 1.1 (<a href="#RFC2616">RFC2616</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="uris">URIs</h4>
<p>A URI is used to identify a resource, including the base service and all Redfish resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>A URI shall be a unique identifier to a resource.</li>
<li>A URI shall be treated by the client as opaque, and thus should not be attempted to be understood or deconstructed by the client</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin operations, a client must know the URI for a resource.</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing a GET operation yields a representation of the resource containing properties and links to associated resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The base resource URI is well known and is based on the protocol version.  Discovering the URIs to additional resources is done through observing the associated resource links returned in previous responses. This type of API that is consumed by navigating URIs returned by the service is known as a Hypermedia API.</p>
<p>The URI is the primary unique identifier of resources.  Redfish considers 3 parts of the URI as described in <a href="#RFC3986">RFC3986</a>. </p>
<p>The first part includes the scheme and authority portions of the URI. The second part includes the root service and version.  The third part is a unique resource identifier.</p>
<p>For example, in the following URL:</p>
<pre><code>Example: https://mgmt.vendor.com/redfish/v1/Systems/1
</code></pre><ul>
<li>The first part is the scheme and authority portion (<a href="https://mgmr.vendor.com">https://mgmr.vendor.com</a>).</li>
<li>The second part is the root service and version (/redfish/v1).</li>
<li>The third part is the unique resource path (Systems/1).</li>
</ul>
<p>The scheme and authority part of the URI shall not be considered part of the unique <em>identifier</em> of the resource. This is due to redirection capabilities and local operations which may result in the variability of the connection portion.  The remainder of the URI (the service and resource paths) is what <em>uniquely identifies</em> the resource, and this is what is returned in all Redfish payloads.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The unique identifier part of a URI shall be unique within the implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a POST may return the following URI in the Location header of the response (indicating the new resource created by the POST):</p>
<pre><code>Example: /redfish/v1/Systems/2
</code></pre><p>Assuming the client is connecting through an appliance named &quot;mgmt.vendor.com&quot;, the full URI needed to access this new resource is <a href="https://mgmt.vendor.com/redfish/v1/Systems/2">https://mgmt.vendor.com/redfish/v1/Systems/2</a>.</p>
<p>URIs, as described in <a href="#RFC3986">RFC3986</a>, may also contain a query (?query) and a frag (#frag) components.  Queries are addressed in the section <a href="#query-parameters">Query Parameters</a>.  Fragments (frag) shall be ignored by the server when used as the URI for submitting an operation. </p>
<h4 id="http-methods">HTTP Methods</h4>
<p>An attractive feature of the RESTful interface is the very limited number of operations which are supported. The following table describes the general mapping of operations to HTTP methods.  If the value in the column entitled &quot;required&quot; has the value &quot;yes&quot; then the HTTP method shall be supported by a Redfish interface.</p>
<table>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Other HTTP methods are not allowed and shall receive a <a href="#status-405">405</a> response.</p>
<h4 id="http-redirect">HTTP Redirect</h4>
<p>HTTP redirect allows a service to redirect a request to another URL. Among other things, this enables Redfish resources to alias areas of the data model.</p>
<ul>
<li>All Redfish Clients shall correctly handle HTTP redirect. </li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Refer to the <a href="#security">Security</a> section for security implications of HTTP Redirect</p>
<h4 id="media-types">Media Types</h4>
<p>Some resources may be available in more than one type of representation. The type of representation is indicated by the media type. </p>
<p>In HTTP messages the media type is specified in the Content-Type header. A client can tell a service that it wants the response to be sent using certain media types by setting the HTTP Accept header to a list of the acceptable media types.</p>
<ul>
<li>All resources shall be made available using the JSON media type
&quot;application/json&quot;.</li>
<li>Redfish services shall make every resource available in a representation based on JSON, as specified in <a href="#RFC4627">RFC4627</a>. Receivers shall not reject a message because it is encoded in JSON, and shall offer at least one response representation based on JSON. An implementation may offer additional representations using non-JSON media types.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients may request compression by specifying an <a href="#request-headers">Accept-Encoding header</a> in the request. </p>
<ul>
<li>Responses to GET requests shall only be compressed if requested by the client. </li>
<li>Services should support gzip compression when requested by the client.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="etags">ETags</h4>
<p>In order to reduce the cases of unnecessary RESTful accesses to resources, the Redfish Service should support associating a separate ETag with each resource.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementations should support returning <a href="#etag-property">ETag properties</a> for each resource.</li>
<li>Implementations should support returning ETag headers for each response that represents a single resource.  Implementations shall support returning ETag headers for certain requests and responses as listed in the <a href="#security">Security</a> section.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ETag is generated and provided as part of the resource payload because the service is in the best position to know if the new version of the object is different enough to be considered substantial. There are two types of ETags: weak and strong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weak model -- only &quot;important&quot; portions of the object are included in formulation of the ETag.  For instance, meta-data such as a last modified time should not be included in the ETag generation. The &quot;important&quot; properties that determine ETag change include writable settings and changeable attributes such as UUID, FRU data, serial numbers, etc.</li>
<li>Strong model -- all portions of the object are included in the formulation of the ETag. </li>
</ul>
<p>This specification does not mandate a particular algorithm for creating the ETag, but ETags should be highly collision-free.  An ETag could be a hash, a generation ID, a time stamp or some other value that changes when the underlying object changes.</p>
<p>If a client PUTs or PATCHes a resource, it should include an ETag in the HTTP If-Match/If-None-Match header from a previous GET.</p>
<p>In addition to returning the ETag property on each resource,</p>
<ul>
<li>A Redfish Service should return the ETag header on client PUT/POST/PATCH</li>
<li>A Redfish Service should return the ETag header on a GET of an individual resource</li>
</ul>
<p>The format of the ETag header is:</p>
<pre><code>ETag W/&quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;
</code></pre><h3 id="protocol-version">Protocol Version</h3>
<p>The protocol version is separate from the version of the resources or the version of the schema supported by them.</p>
<p>Each version of the Redfish protocol is strongly typed.  This is accomplished using the URI of the Redfish service in combination with the resource obtained at that URI, called the ServiceRoot. </p>
<p>The root URI for this version of the Redfish protocol shall be &quot;/redfish/v1&quot;.</p>
<p>While the major version of the protocol is represented in the URI, the major version, minor version and errata version of the protocol are represented in the Version property of the ServiceRoot resource, as defined in the Schema for that resource.  The protocol version is a string of the form: </p>
<p><em>MajorVersion</em>.<em>MinorVersion</em>.<em>Errata</em></p>
<p> where:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>MajorVersion</em> = integer:  something in the class changed in a backward incompatible way.</li>
<li><em>MinorVersion</em> = integer:  a minor update.  New functionality may have been added but nothing removed. Compatibility will be preserved with previous  minorversions.</li>
<li><em>Errata</em> = integer: something in the prior version was broken and needed to be fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any resource discovered through links found by accessing the root service or any service or resource referenced using references from the root service shall conform to the same version of the protocol supported by the root service.</p>
<p>A GET on the resource &quot;/redfish&quot; shall return the following body:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">    {
    &quot;v1&quot;: &quot;/redfish/v1&quot;
    }
</code></pre>
<h3 id="requests">Requests</h3>
<p>This section describes the requests that can be sent to Redfish services.</p>
<h4 id="request-headers">Request Headers</h4>
<p>HTTP defines headers that can be used in request messages. The following table defines those headers and their requirements for Redfish services.</p>
<ul>
<li>Redfish services shall understand and be able to process the headers in the following table as defined by the HTTP 1.1 specification if the value in the Required column is set to &quot;Yes&quot;.</li>
<li>Redfish services shall understand and be able to process the headers in the following table as defined by the HTTP 1.1 specification if the value in the Required column is set to &quot;Conditional&quot; under the conditions noted in the description.</li>
<li>Redfish services should understand and be able to process the headers in the following tables as defined by the HTTP 1.1 specification if the value in the Required column is set to &quot;No&quot;.  </li>

<h4 id="read-requests-get-">Read Requests (GET)</h4>
<p>The GET method is used to retrieve a representation of a resource.  That representation can either be a single resource or a collection. The service will return the representation using one of the media types specified in the Accept header, subject to requirements in the Media Types section <a href="#media-types">Media Types</a>. If the Accept header is not present, the service will return the resources representations as application/json.</p>
<ul>
<li>The HTTP GET method shall be used to retrieve a resource without causing any side effects.</li>
<li>The service shall ignore the content of the body on a GET.</li>
<li>The GET operation shall be idempotent in the absence of outside changes to the resource.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="service-root-request">Service Root Request</h5>
<p>The root URL for Redfish version 1 services shall be &quot;/redfish/v1&quot;.</p>
<p>Additionally, the latest supported Redfish service shall be aliased at &quot;/redfish&quot;. In this case the endpoint at &quot;/redfish&quot; may be an HTTP redirect to &quot;/redfish/v1&quot;.</p>
<p>The root URL for the service returns a RootService resource as defined by this specification.</p>
<h5 id="metadata-document-request">Metadata Document Request</h5>
<p>Redfish services shall expose a <a href="#service-metadata">metadata document</a> describing the service at the &quot;/redfish/v1/$metadata&quot; resource. This metadata document describes the resources and collections available at the root, and references additional metadata documents describing the full set of resource types exposed by the service.</p>
<h5 id="odata-service-document-request">OData Service Document Request</h5>
<p>Redfish services shall expose an <a href="#odata-service-document">OData Service Document</a>, at the &quot;/redfish/v1/odata&quot; resource. This service document provides a standard format for enumerating the resources exposed by the service, enabling generic hypermedia-driven OData clients to navigate to the resources of the service.</p>
<h5 id="resource-retrieval-requests">Resource Retrieval Requests</h5>
<h6 id="query-parameters">Query Parameters</h6>
<p>When the resource addressed is a collection, the client can use the following paging query options to specify that a subset of the members be returned.   </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Attribute</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>$skip</td>
<td>Integer indicating the number of resources in the collection to skip before retrieving the first resource.</td>
<td><a href="http://collection?$skip=5">http://collection?$skip=5</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$top</td>
<td>Integer indicating the number of collection members to include in the response. The minimum value for this parameter is 1.  The default behavior is to return all members.</td>
<td><a href="http://collection?$top=30">http://collection?$top=30</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li>Services should support the $top and $skip query parameters. </li>
<li>Implementation shall return the 501, Not Implemented, status code for any query parameters starting with &quot;$&quot; that are not supported, and should return an <a href="#error-response">extended error</a> indicating the requested query parameter(s) not supported for this resource.</li>
<li>Implementations shall ignore unknown or unsupported query parameters that do not begin with &quot;$&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="retrieving-collections">Retrieving Collections</h6>
<p>Retrieving a collection is done by sending the HTTP GET method to the URI for the collection. The response will be a <a href="#resource-collections">resource collection representation</a> that includes the collection&#39;s attributes as well as the list of the members of the collection. A subset of the members can be returned using <a href="#query-parameters">client paging query parameters</a>.</p>
<p>No requirements are placed on implementations to return a consistent set of members when a series of requests using paging query parameters are made over time to obtain the entire set of members. It is possible that this could result in missed or duplicate elements being retrieved if multiple GETs are used to retrieve a collection using paging.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients shall not make assumptions about the URIs for the resource members of a collection.</li>
<li>Retrieved collections shall always include the <a href="#resource-count-property">count</a> property to specify the total number of members in the collection.</li>
<li>If only a portion of the collection is returned due to client-specified paging query parameters or services returning <a href="#partial-results">partial results</a>, then the total number of resources across all pages shall be returned in the count property.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="head">HEAD</h4>
<p>The HEAD method differs from the GET method in that it MUST NOT return message body information.  However, all of the same meta information and status codes in the HTTP headers will be returned as though a GET method were processed, including authorization checks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Services may support the HEAD method in order to return meta information in the the form of HTTP response headers.</li>
<li>Services may support the HEAD method in order to verify link validity.</li>
<li>Services may support the HEAD method in order to verify resource accessibility</li>
<li>Services shall not support any other use of the HEAD method.</li>
<li>The HEAD method shall be idempotent in the absence of outside changes to the resource.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="data-modification-requests">Data Modification Requests</h4>
<h5 id="update-patch-">Update (PATCH)</h5>
<p>The PATCH method is the preferred method used to perform updates on pre-existing resources.  Changes to the resource are sent in the request body. Properties not specified in the request body are not directly changed by the PATCH request.  The response is either empty or a representation of the resource after the update was done. The implementation may reject the update operation on certain fields based on its own policies and, if so, shall not apply any of the update requested.  Updates to resources are idempotent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Services shall support the PATCH method to update a resource. If the resource can never be updated, status code <a href="#status-405">405</a> shall be returned.</li>
<li>Services may return a representation of the resource after any server-side transformations in the body of the response.</li>
<li>If a property in the request can never be updated, such as when a property is read only, a status code of <a href="#status-200">200</a> shall be returned along with a representation of the resource containing an <a href="#extended-information">annotation</a> specifying the non-updatable property. In this success case, other properties may be updated in the resource. </li>
<li>Services should return status code <a href="#status-405">405</a> if the client specifies a PATCH request against a collection.</li>
<li>The PATCH operation should be idempotent in the absence of outside changes to the resource provided it is used with ETags to prevent subsequent PATCH attempts. Note that the ETAG value should change as the result of this operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>OData markup (<a href="#resource-identifier-property">resource identifiers</a>, <a href="type-property">type</a>, <a href="#etag-property">etag</a> and <a href="links-property">links</a>) are ignored on Update.</p>
<h5 id="replace-put-">Replace (PUT)</h5>
<p>The PUT method is used to completely replace a resource.  Properties omitted from the request body are reset to their default value.</p>
<ul>
<li>Services may support the PUT method to replace a resource in whole.  If a service does not implement this method, status code <a href="#status-405">405</a> shall be returned. </li>
<li>Services may return a representation of the resource after any server-side transformations in the body of the response.</li>
<li>Services should return status code <a href="#status-405">405</a> if the client specifies a PUT request against a collection.</li>
<li>The PUT operation should be idempotent in the absence of outside changes to the resource, with the possible exception that ETAG values may change as the result of this operation.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="create-post-">Create (POST)</h5>
<p>The POST method is used to create new resources. The POST request is submitted to the resource collection in which the new resource is to belong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Services shall support the POST method for creating resources. If the resource does not offer anything to be created, a status code <a href="#status-405">405</a> shall be returned.</li>
<li>The POST operation shall not be idempotent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The body of the create request contains a representation of the object to be created. The service can ignore any service controlled attributes (e.g. id), forcing those attributes to be overridden by the service. The service shall set the Location header to the URI of the newly created resource. The response to a successful create request should be 201 (Created) and may include a response body containing the representation of the newly created resource.</p>
<h5 id="delete-delete-">Delete (DELETE)</h5>
<p>The DELETE method is used to remove a resource.</p>
<ul>
<li>Services shall support the DELETE method for resources that can be deleted. If the resource can never be deleted, status code <a href="#status-405">405</a> shall be returned.</li>
<li>Services may return a representation of the just deleted resource in the response body.</li>
<li>Services should return status code <a href="#status-405">405</a> if the client specifies a DELETE request against a collection.</li>
<li>The DELETE operation shall not be not idempotent.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="actions-post-">Actions (POST)</h5>
<p>The POST method is used to initiate operations on the object (such as Actions).</p>
<ul>
<li>Services shall support the POST method for sending actions.</li>
<li>The POST operation may not be idempotent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Custom actions are requested on a resource by sending the HTTP POST method to the URI of the action. If the <a href="#actions-property">actions property</a> within a resource does not specify a target property, then the URI of an action shall be of the form:</p>
<p> <em>ResourceUri</em>/Actions/<em>QualifiedActionName</em></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><em>ResourceUri</em> is the URL of the resource which supports invoking the action.</li>
<li>&quot;Actions&quot; is the name of the property containing the actions for a resource, as defined by this specification.</li>
<li><em>QualifiedActionName</em> is the name of the action qualified by the namespace alias. </li>
</ul>
<p>The first parameter of a bound function is the resource on which the action is being invoked. The remaining parameters are represented as name/value pairs in the body of the request.</p>
<p>Clients can query a resource directly to determine the <a href="#actions-property">actions</a> that are available as well as <a href="#allowable-values">valid parameter values</a> for those actions.  Some parameter information may require the client to examine the schema corresponding to the resource. </p>
<p>For instance, if a schema document <code>http://schemas.dmtf.org/redfish/v1/ComputerSystem.0.96.0</code> defines a Reset action, in the <code>ComputerSystem.0.96.0</code> namespace, with the alias &quot;ComputerSystem&quot;, bound to the <code>ComputerSystem.Actions</code> type, such as this example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;Schema Name=&quot;ComputerSystem.0.96.0&quot; Alias=&quot;ComputerSystem&quot;&gt;
...
  &lt;Action Name=&quot;Reset&quot; Isbound=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Parameter Name=&quot;Resource&quot; Type=&quot;ComputerSystem.Actions&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;Parameter Name=&quot;ResetType&quot; Type=&quot;ComputerSystem.ResetType&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/Action&gt;
...
&lt;/Schema&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And a computer system resource contains an <a href="#actions-property">Actions</a> property such as this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">&quot;Actions&quot;: {
    &quot;#ComputerSystem.Reset&quot;: {
        &quot;target&quot;:&quot;/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset&quot;,
        &quot;ResetType@DMTF.AllowableValues&quot;: [
            &quot;On&quot;,
            &quot;ForceOff&quot;,
            &quot;GracefulRestart&quot;,
            &quot;ForceRestart&quot;,
            &quot;Nmi&quot;,
            &quot;ForceOn&quot;,
            &quot;PushPowerButton&quot;
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then the following would represent a possible request for the Action:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">POST /redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset
{
    &quot;ResetType&quot;: &quot;On&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="responses">Responses</h3>
<p>Redfish defines four types of responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#metadata-responses">Metadata Responses</a> - Describe the resources and types exposed by the service to generic clients.</li>
<li><a href="#resource-responses">Resource Responses</a> - JSON representation of an individual resource.</li>

Clients are not required to request metadata if they already have sufficient understanding of the target service; for example, to request and interpret a JSON representation of a resource defined in this specification. </p>
<h5 id="service-metadata">Service Metadata</h5>
<p>The service metadata describes top-level resources and resource types of the service according to <a href="#OData-CSDL">OData-Schema</a>. The Redfish Service Metadata is represented as an XML document with a root element named &quot;Edmx&quot;, defined in the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edmx">http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edmx</a>&quot; namespace, and with an OData Version attribute equal to &quot;4.0&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;edmx:Edmx xmlns:edmx=&quot;http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edmx&quot; Version=&quot;4.0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!-- edmx:Reference and edmx:Schema elements go here --&gt;
&lt;/edmx:Edmx&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The service metadata shall include the namespaces for each of the DMTF resource types, along with the &quot;DMTFExtensions.0.96.0&quot; namespace. These references may use the standard Uri for the hosted schema definitions (i.e., on <a href="http://dmtf.org/schema">http://dmtf.org/schema</a>) or a Url to a local version of the schema that shall be identical to the hosted version. The namespace shall be aliased with the version-independent namespace name.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;edmx:Reference Uri=&quot;http://schemas.dmtf.org/redfish/v1/ServiceRoot.0.96.0&quot;&gt;

&lt;/edmx:Reference&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The service metadata shall include an entity container that defines the top level resource and collections. This entity container shall extend the ServiceContainer defined in the ServiceRoot.0.96.0 schema and may include additional resources or collections.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;edmx:DataServices&gt;
    &lt;Schema xmlns=&quot;http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/edm&quot; Namespace=&quot;Service&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/Schema&gt;
&lt;/edmx:DataServices&gt;
</code></pre>
<h6 id="referencing-oem-extensions">Referencing OEM Extensions</h6>
<p>The metadata document may reference additional schema documents describing OEM-specific extensions used by the ServiceRoot, for example custom types for additional collections.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;edmx:Reference Uri=&quot;http://contoso.org/Schema/CustomTypes&quot;&gt;
    &lt;edmx:Include Namespace=&quot;CustomTypes&quot; Alias=&quot;Contoso&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/edmx:Reference&gt;
</code></pre>
<h6 id="annotations">Annotations</h6>
<p>The service can annotate sets, types, actions and parameters with Redfish-defined or custom annotation terms. These annotations are typically in a separate Annotations file referenced from the service metadata document using the IncludeAnnotations directive. The alias of the namespace containing system annotations shall be &quot;Annotations&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;edmx:Reference Uri=&quot;http://service/metadata/Service.Annotations&quot;&gt;
    &lt;edmx:IncludeAnnotations TermNamespace=&quot;Annotations.0.96.0&quot; Alias=&quot;Annotations&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/edmx:Reference&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The annotation file itself specifies the Target schema element being annotated, the Term being applied, and the value of the term:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;Annotations Target=&quot;ComputerSystem.Reset/ResetType&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Annotation Term=&quot;Annotations.AdditionalValues&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Collection&gt;

        },
        ...
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>The OData Service Document shall be a returned as a JSON object, using the MIME type <code>application/json</code>.</p>
<p>The JSON object shall contain a context property named &quot;@odata.context&quot; with a value of &quot;/redfish/v1/$metadata&quot;. This context tells a generic OData client how to find the <a href="#service-metadata">service metadata</a> describing the types exposed by the service.</p>
<p>The JSON object shall include a property named &quot;value&quot; whose value is a JSON array containing an entry for the <a href="#service-root-request">service root</a> and each resource that is a direct child of the service root.</p>
<p>Each entry shall be represented as a JSON object and shall include a &quot;name&quot; property whose value is a user-friendly name of the resource, a &quot;kind&quot; property whose value is &quot;Singleton&quot; for individual resources (including collection resources) or &quot;EntitySet&quot; for top-level resource collections, and a &quot;url&quot; property whose value is the relative URL for the top-level resource.</p>
<h4 id="resource-responses">Resource Responses</h4>
<p>Resources are returned as JSON payloads, using the MIME type <code>application/json</code>.</p>
<h5 id="context-property">Context Property</h5>
<p>Responses that represent a single resource shall contain a context property named &quot;@odata.context&quot; describing the source of the payload. The value of the context property shall be the context URL that describes the resource according to <a href="#OData-Protocol">OData-Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>The context URL for a resource that exists within a collection is of the form:</p>
<p> <em>MetadataUrl</em>.#<em>Collection</em>[(<em>Selectlist</em>)]/$entity </p>
<p>Where: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>MetadataUrl</em> = the metadata url of the service (/redfish/v1/$metadata)</li>
<li><em>Collection</em> = the collection resource. For contained resources this includes the path from the root collection or singleton resource to the containment property.</li>
<li><em>Selectlist</em> = comma-separated <a href="#select-list">list of properties</a> included in the response if the response includes a subset of properties defined for the represented resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>The context URL for a resource that is a top-level singleton resource is of the form:</p>
<p> <em>MetadataUrl</em>.#<em>SingletonName</em>[(<em>Selectlist</em>)]</p>
<p>Where: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>MetadataUrl</em> = the metadata url of the service (/redfish/v1/$metadata)</li>
<li><em>SingletonName</em> = the name of the top-level singleton resource</li>
<li><em>Selectlist</em> = comma-separated <a href="#select-list">list of properties</a> included in the response if the response includes a subset of properties defined for the represented resources.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="select-list">Select List</h6>
<p>If a response contains a subset of the properties defined in the schema for a type, then the context URL shall specify the subset of properties included. An asterix (*) can be used to specify &quot;all structural properties&quot; for a given resource.</p>
<p>Expanded navigation properties shall be included in the select list if the result includes a subset of the properties defined for the expanded resource.</p>
<p>For example, the following context URL specifies that the result contains a single resource from the Members collection nested under the Links property of the Systems resource:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">&quot;@odata.context&quot;:&quot;/redfish/v1/$metadata#Systems/Links/Members/$entity&quot;,
</code></pre>
<h5 id="resource-identifier-property">Resource Identifier Property</h5>
<p>Resources in a response shall include a unique identifier property named &quot;@odata.id&quot;. The value of the identifier property shall be the <a href="#URIs">unique identifier</a> for the resource.</p>
<p>Resource Identifiers shall be represented in JSON payloads as uri paths relative to the schema portion of the uri. That is, they shall always start with &quot;/redfish/&quot;.</p>
<p>The resource identifier is the canonical URL for the resource and can be used to retrieve or edit the resource, as appropriate.</p>
<h5 id="type-property">Type Property</h5>
<p>All resources in a response shall include a type property named &quot;@odata.type&quot;. The value of the type property shall be an absolute URL that specifies the type of the resource and shall be of the form:</p>
<p> <em>*#</em>Namespace<em>.</em>TypeName*</p>
<p>Where: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Namespace</em> = The full namespace name of the schema in which the type is defined. For Redfish resources this will be the versioned namespace name. </li>
<li><em>TypeName</em> = The name of the type of the resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>The client may issue a GET request to this URL using a content type of <code>application/xml</code> in order to retrieve a document containing the <a href="#resource-definition">definition of the resource</a>.</p>
<h5 id="etag-property">ETag Property</h5>
<p>ETags provide the ability to conditionally retrieve or update a resource. Resources should include an ETag property named &quot;@odata.etag&quot;. The value of the ETag property is the <a href="#etags">Etag</a> for a resource.</p>
<h5 id="primitive-properties">Primitive Properties</h5>
<p>Primitive properties are returned as JSON values. </p>
<h6 id="datetime-values">DateTime Values</h6>
<p>DateTime values shall be returned as JSON strings according to the ISO 8601 &quot;extended&quot; format: </p>
<p> <em>YYYY</em>-<em>MM</em>-<em>DD</em> T <em>hh</em>:<em>mm</em>:<em>ss</em>[.<em>SSS</em>] (Z | (+ | - ) <em>hh</em>:<em>mm</em>)</p>
<h5 id="structured-properties">Structured Properties</h5>
<p>Structured properties, defined as <a href="#structured-types">complex types</a> or <a href="#expand-resources">expanded</a> <a href="#resource-type-definitions">resource types</a>, are returned as JSON objects. The type of the JSON object is specified in schema definition of the property containing the structured value.</p>
<h5 id="collection-properties">Collection Properties</h5>
<p>Collection-valued properties are returned as JSON arrays, where each element of the array is a JSON object whose type is specified in the schema document describing the containing type.</p>
<p>Collection-valued properties may contain a subset of the members of the full collection. In this case, the collection-valued property shall be annotated with a next link property. The property representing the next link shall be a peer of the collection-valued property, with the name of the collection-valued property suffixed with &quot;@odata.nextLink&quot;. The value of the next link property shall be an opaque URL that the client can use to retrieve the next set of collection members. The next link property shall only be present if the number of resources requested is greater than the number of resources returned.</p>
<p>Collection-valued properties shall be annotated with a count. The property representing the count is a peer of the collection-valued property, with the name of the collection-valued property suffixed with &quot;@odata.count&quot;. The value of the count is the total number of members available in the collection.</p>
<p>Collection-valued properties shall not be null. Empty collections shall be returned in JSON as an empty array.</p>
<h5 id="actions-property">Actions Property</h5>
<p>Available actions for a resource are represented as individual properties nested under a single structured property on the resource named &quot;Actions&quot;.</p>
<h6 id="action-representation">Action Representation</h6>
<p>Actions are represented by a property nested under &quot;Actions&quot; whose name is the unique URI that identifies the action. This URI shall be of the form:</p>
<p>  <em>*#</em>NamespaceAlias<em>.</em>ActionName*</p>
<p>Where: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>NamespaceAlias</em> = The namespace alias used in the reference to the schema in which the action is defined. For Redfish resources this shall be the version-independent namespace alias. </li>
<li><em>ActionName</em> = The name of the action</li>
</ul>
<p>The client may issue a GET request to this URL using a content type of <code>application/xml</code> in order to retrieve the schema document containing the <a href="#resource-actions">definition of the action</a>.</p>
<p>The value of the property is a JSON object containing a property named &quot;target&quot; whose value is a relative or absolute URL used to invoke the action.</p>
<p>The property representing the available action may be annotated with the <a href="#allowable-values">AllowableValues</a> annotation in order to specify the list of allowable values for a particular parameter.</p>
<p>For example, the following property represents the Reset action, defined in the ComputerSystem.0.96.0 namespace (aliased with the version-independent &quot;ComputerSystem&quot;):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">    &quot;#ComputerSystem.Reset&quot;: {
        &quot;target&quot;:&quot;/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset&quot;,
            &quot;ResetType@DMTF.AllowableValues&quot;: [&quot;On&quot;,&quot;Off&quot;, &quot;Reset&quot;]
       }
</code></pre>
<p>Given this, the client could invoke a POST request to /redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset with the following body:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
    &quot;ResetType&quot;: &quot;On&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<h6 id="allowable-values">Allowable Values</h6>
<p>The property representing the action may be annotated with the &quot;AllowableValues&quot; annotation in order to specify the list of allowable values for a particular parameter. </p>
<p>The set of allowable values is specified by including a property whose name is the name of the parameter followed by &quot;@DMTF.AllowableValues&quot;, and whose value is a JSON array of strings representing the allowable values for the parameter.</p>
<h5 id="links-property">Links Property</h5>
<p><a href="#reference-properties">References</a> to other resources are represented by the links property on the resource. </p>
<p>The links property shall be named &quot;Links&quot; and shall contain a property for each navigation property defined in the schema for that type. For single-valued navigation properties, the value of the property shall be the <a href="#reference-to-a-single-related-resource">single related resource id</a>. For collection-valued navigation properties, the value of the property shall be the <a href="#array-of-references-to-related-resources">array of related resource ids</a>.</p>
<p>The links property shall also include an <a href="#oem-property">Oem property</a> for navigating vendor-specific links.</p>
<h6 id="reference-to-a-single-related-resource">Reference to a Single Related Resource</h6>
<p>A reference to a single resource is returned as a JSON object containing a single <a href="#resource-identifier-property">resource-identifier-property</a> whose name is the name of the relationship and whose value is the uri of the referenced resource.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
&quot;Links&quot; : {

<p>The client can get the definition of the annotation from the the <a href="#service-metadata">service metadata</a>, or may ignore the annotation entirely, but should not fail reading the response due to unrecognized annotations, including new annotations defined within the DMTF namespace.</p>
<h4 id="error-responses">Error Responses</h4>
<p>HTTP response status codes alone often do not provide enough information to enable deterministic error semantics. For example, if a client does a PATCH and some of the properties do not match while others are not supported, simply returning an HTTP status code of 400 does not tell the client which values were in error. Error responses provide the client more meaningful and deterministic error semantics. </p>
<p>Error responses are defined by an extended error resource, represented as a single JSON object with a property named &quot;error&quot;. The value of this property shall be an <a href="#extended-information-object">extended information object</a>.</p>
<h5 id="extended-information-object">Extended Information Object</h5>
<p>Extended Information Objects provide additional information about an <a href="#extended-object-information">object</a>, <a href="#extended-property-information">property</a>, or <a href="#error-responses">error response</a>. </p>
<p>Extended information is represented as a JSON object with the following properties:</p>

<p>Error codes identify specific errors defined in a message registry.</p>
<p>The value of the code property shall be of the form</p>
<p> <em>RegistryName</em>.<em>MajorVersion</em>.<em>MinorVersion</em>.<em>MessageKey</em> </p>
<p>where </p>
<ul>
<li><em>RegistryName</em> is the name of the registry. The registry name shall be Pascal-cased.</li>
<li><em>MajorVersion</em> is a positive integer representing the major version of the registry</li>
<li><em>MinorVersion</em> is a positive integer representing the minor version of the registry </li>
<li><em>MessageKey</em> is a human-readable key into the registry. The message key shall be Pascal-cased and shall not include spaces, periods or special chars.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The client can use the error code to search the message registry for the corresponding message.</p>
<p>The message registry approach has advantages for internationalization (since the registry can be translated easily) and light weight implementation (since large strings need not be included with the implementation).</p>
<h2 id="data-model-schema">Data Model &amp; Schema</h2>
<p>One of the key tenants of the Redfish interface is the separation of protocol and data model.  This section describes common data model, resource, and Redfish Schema requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each resource shall be strongly typed according to a <a href="#resource-type-definition">resource type definition</a>. The type shall be defined in a <a href="#schema-documents">schema document</a> and identified by a unique <a href="#type-identifier">type identifier</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="type-identifiers">Type Identifiers</h3>
<p>Types are identified by a <em>Type URI</em>. The full URI for a type is of the form:</p>
<p> <em>*#</em>Namespace<em>.</em>TypeName* </p>
<p>where: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Namespace</em> = the full name or alias of the namespace in which the type is defined </li>
<li><em>TypeName</em> = the name of the type</li>
</ul>
<p>The full namespace for types defined by this specification is of the form:</p>
<p> <em>ResourceTypeName</em>.<em>MajorVersion</em>.<em>MinorVersion</em>.<em>Errata</em></p>
<p>where </p>
<ul>
<li><em>ResourceTypeName</em> = the name of the resource type. For <a href="#structured-types">structured (complex) types</a>, <a href="#enums">enumerations</a>, and <a href="#resource-actions">actions</a>, this is generally the name of the containing resource type. </li>
<li><em>MajorVersion</em> = integer: something in the class changed in a backward incompatible way.</li>
<li><em>MinorVersion</em> = integer: a minor update. New properties may have been added but nothing removed. Compatibility will be preserved with previous minorversions. </li>
<li><em>Errata</em> = integer: something in the prior version was broken and needed to be fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a valid type namespace might be &quot;System.0.96.0&quot;. </p>
<h4 id="type-identifiers-in-json">Type Identifiers in JSON</h4>
<p>Types used within a JSON payload shall be defined in, or referenced, by the <a href="#service-metadata">service metadata</a>.</p>
<p>Resource types defined by this specification shall be referenced in JSON documents using the full (versioned) namespace name. </p>
<p>Non-resource types (for example enumerations, complex types, and actions) shall be referenced in JSON documents using the version-independent namespace alias defined in the <a href="#service-metadata">service metadata</a>.</p>
<p>NOTE: Refer to the <a href="#security">Security</a> section for security implications of Data Model &amp; Schema</p>
<h3 id="common-naming-conventions">Common Naming Conventions</h3>
<p>The Redfish interface is intended to be easily readable and intuitive.  Thus, consistency helps the consumer who is unfamiliar with a newly discovered property understand its use.  While this is no substitute for the normative information in the specification and schema, the following rules help with readability and client usage. </p>
<p>Resource Name, Property Names, and constants such as Enumerations shall be Pascal-cased</p>
<ul>
<li>The first letter of each word shall be upper case with spaces between words shall be removed  (eg PowerState, SerialNumber.)</li>
<li>No underscores are used. </li>
<li>Both characters are capitalized for two-character acronyms (eg IPAddress, RemoteIP)</li>
<li>Only the first character of acronyms with three or more characters is capitalized, except the first word of a Pascal-cased identifier (eg Wwn, VirtualWwn)</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions are allowed for the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well-known technology names like &quot;iSCSI&quot;</li>
<li>Product names like &quot;iLO&quot;</li>
<li>Well-known abbreviations or acronyms</li>
</ul>
<p>For attributes that have units, or other special meaning, the unit identifier should be appended to the name. The current list includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth (Mbps), (eg PortSpeedMbps)</li>
<li>CPU speed (Mhz), (eg ProcessorSpeedMhz)</li>
<li>Memory size (MegaBytes, MB), (eg MemoryMB)</li>
<li>Counts of items (Count), (eg ProcessorCount, FanCount)</li>
<li>The State of a resource (State) (eg PowerState.)</li>
<li>State values where &quot;work&quot; is being done end in (ing) (eg Applying, Clearing)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="localization-considerations">Localization Considerations</h3>
<p>The Redfish architecture supports localized strings but does not impose any specific requirement for localization upon services.  However, current market forces seem to require localization as necessary (e.g. schemas).</p>
<p>Schema-supplied display strings may be localized as necessary, but a Schema file may only contain one language.  Alternate language schemas may be published and available to Redfish clients, but need not be provided via the Redfish schema store. </p>
<p>Property names defined within a Redfish schema are never localized. User-supplied string-valued property values such as an asset tag may be localized. Localizable string valued properties should be annotated with the <a href="#language-dependent-property-values">IsLanguageDependent annotation term</a>.</p>
<h3 id="schema-definition">Schema Definition</h3>
<p>Individual resources and their dependent types and actions are defined within a <a href="#schema-documents">schema document</a>.</p>
<h4 id="common-annotations">Common Annotations</h4>
<p>All Redfish types and properties shall include <a href="#description">description</a> and <a href="#long-description">long description</a> annotations. </p>
<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>The Description annotation can be applied to any type, property, action or parameter in order to provide a human-readable description of the schema element.</p>

<p>The <code>LongDescription</code> annotation term is defined in <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/os/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.xml">http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/os/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.xml</a>.</p>
<h4 id="schema-documents">Schema Documents</h4>
<p>Individual resources are defined as entity types within a schema document according to <a href="#OData-CSDL">OData-Schema</a>. The representation may include annotations to facilitate automatic generation of JSON Schema capable of validating JSON payloads.</p>
<p>The outer element of the schema document shall be the <code>Edmx</code> element, and shall have a <code>Version</code> attribute with a value of &quot;4.0&quot;.</p>

<h5 id="referencing-other-schemas">Referencing other Schemas</h5>
<p>Schemas may reference types defined in other schema documents by including a <code>Reference</code> element. </p>
<p>The reference element specifies the <code>Uri</code> of the schema document describing the referenced type and has one or more child <code>Include</code> elements that specify the <code>Namespace</code> attribute containing the types to be referenced, along with an optional <code>Alias</code> attribute for that namespace.</p>
<p>Type definitions generally reference the OData and DMTF namespaces for common type annotation terms, and resource type definitions reference the DMTF Resource.0.96.0 namespace for base types. Schemas that include measures such as temperature, speed, or dimensions generally include the <a href="#OData-Measures">OData Measures namespace</a>. </p>

<h5 id="custom-annotations">Custom Annotations</h5>
<p>This specification defines a set of common annotations for extending the definition of resource types used by Redfish. In addition, services may define custom annotations.</p>
<p>Services may apply annotations to resources in order to provide service-specific information about the type, such as whether the service supports modifications of particular properties.</p>
<p>Services can apply annotations to existing resources where those resources don&#39;t already define a value for the annotation. Services cannot change the value of an annotation applied as part of the resource definition.  </p>
<p>Because <a href="#annotations">service annotations</a> may be applied to existing resource definitions, they are generally specified in a service-specific metadata document referenced by the <a href="#service-metadata">service metadata</a>.</p>
<h3 id="common-redfish-resource-properties">Common Redfish Resource Properties</h3>
<p>This section contains a set of common properties across all Redfish resources. The property names in this section shall not be used for any other purpose, even if they are not implemented in a particular resource.</p>
<p>Common properties are defined in the base Resource.0.96.0.Resource schema.</p>
<h4 id="id">Id</h4>
<p>The Id property of a resource identifies the resource within a collection.</p>
<h4 id="name">Name</h4>
<p>The Name property is used to convey a human readable moniker for the resource.  The type of the Name property shall be string.</p>
<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Description property is used to convey a human readable description of the resource.  The type of the Description property shall be string.</p>
<h4 id="modified">Modified</h4>
<p>The Modified property contains the time stamp equal to the last time the Redfish service modified this resource. The format of this property shall be the <a href="#standard-timestamp-format">Standard Timestamp Format</a>. </p>
<h4 id="status">Status</h4>
<p>The Status property represents the status of a resource. </p>
<p>The value of the status property is a common status object type as defined by this specification. By having a common representation of status, clients can depend on consistent semantics. The Status object is capable of indicating the current intended state, the state the resource has been requested to change to, the current actual state and any problem affecting the current state of the resource.</p>
<h4 id="links">Links</h4>
<p>The <a href="#links-property">Links property</a> represents the links associated with the resource, as defined by that resources schema definition. All navigation properties defined for a resource shall be nested under the links property.</p>
<h4 id="actions">Actions</h4>
<p>The <a href="#actions-property">Actions property</a> contains the actions supported by a resource. </p>
<h4 id="oem">OEM</h4>
<p>The <a href="#oem-property">OEM property</a> is used for OEM extensions as defined in <a href="#schema-extensibility">Schema Extensibility</a>. </p>
<h4 id="settings">Settings</h4>
<p>The Settings property contains a URI that the client can use to PUT properties or PATCH property changes for resources that are not directly <a href="#update-patch">updatable</a>. </p>
<p>If the resource itself is read only but has a partner Setting resource, this is used to make changes at some point in the future to the resource.  </p>
<h4 id="settingsresult">SettingsResult</h4>
<p>The SettingsResult property represents the result of the last Setting Data.</p>
<p>The value of the SettingsResult property is a JSON object containing the results of applying a Setting resource to this resource. This SettingsResult object contains the following information about the last Setting Data apply result, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time of the attempted application</li>
<li>ETag of the Setting Data object that was applied</li>
<li>Redfish <a href="#extended-object-information">Extended Information</a> containing status information </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="redfish-resources">Redfish Resources</h3>
<p>Collectively known as the Redfish Schema, the set of resource descriptions contains normative requirements on implementations conforming to this specification. </p>
<p>Redfish Resources are one of several general kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root Service Resource<ul>
<li>Contains the mapping of a particular service instance to applicable subtending resources.</li>
<li>Contains the UUID of a service instance.  This UUID would be the same UUID returned via SSDP discovery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current Configuration Resources, contain a mixture of:<ul>
<li>Inventory (static and read-only)</li>
<li>Health Telemetry (dynamic and read-only)</li>
<li>Current Configuration Settings (dynamic and read/write)</li>
<li>Current Metric values</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Setting Resources<ul>
<li>Dynamic, Read/Write Pending Configuration Settings </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Services<ul>
<li>Common services like Eventing, Tasks, Sessions </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Registry Resources<ul>
<li>Static, Read-Only JSON encoded information for Event and Message Registries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="current-configuration">Current Configuration</h4>
<p>Current Configuration resources represent the service&#39;s knowledge of the current state and configuration of the resource.  This may be directly updatable with a PATCH or it may be read-only by the client and the client must PATCH to a separate Setting resource.</p>
<h4 id="settings">Settings</h4>
<p>Setting resources represent the future state and configuration of the resource.  This property is always paired with a Current Configuration object.  Where the Current Configuration object represents the current state, the settings resource represents the future intended state.  The state of the resource is changed either directly, such as with a POST of an action or PUT of a reset or indirectly, such as when a user reboots a machine outside of the Redfish service.  </p>
<h4 id="services">Services</h4>
<p>Service resources represent components of the Redfish Service itself as well as dependent resources.  While the complete list is discoverable only by traversing the Redfish Service tree, the list includes services like the Eventing service, Task management and Session management.</p>
<h4 id="registry">Registry</h4>
<p>Registry resources are those resources that assist the client in interpreting Redfish resources beyond the Schema definitions.  Examples of registries include Message Registries, Event Registries and enumeration registries, such as those used for BIOS.  In registries, a identifier is used to retrieve more information about a given resource, event, message or other item.  This can include other properties, property restrictions and the like.  Registries are themselves resources.</p>
<h3 id="special-resource-situations">Special Resource Situations</h3>
<p>There are some situations that arise with certain kinds of resources that need to exhibit common semantic behavior.</p>
<h4 id="absent-resources">Absent Resources</h4>
<p>Resources may be either absent or their state unknown at the time a client requests information about that resource.  For removed resources where the URI is expected to remain constant (such as when a fan is removed), the Resource should represent the State property of the Status object as &quot;Absent&quot;.  In this circumstance, any required or supported properties for which there is no known value shall be represented as null.</p>
<h4 id="schema-variations">Schema Variations</h4>
<p>There are cases when deviations from the published schema are necessary.  An example is BIOS where different servers may have minor variations in available configuration settings.  A provider may build a single schema that is a superset of the individual implementations.  In order to support these variations, Redfish supports omitting parameters defined in the class schema in the current configuration object.  The following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Redfish services must support attempts to set unsupported configuration elements in the Setting Data by marking them as exceptions in the Setting Data Apply status structure, but not failing the entire configuration operation.</li>
<li>The support of a specific property in a resource is signaled by the presence of that property in the Current Configuration object.  If the element is missing from Current Configuration, the client may assume the element is not supported on that resource.</li>
<li>For ENUM configuration items that may have variation in allowable values, a special read-only capabilities element will be added to Current Configuration which specifies limits to the element.  This is an override for the schema only to be used when necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providers may split the schema resources into separate files such as Schema + String Registry, each with a separate URI and different Content-Encoding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Resources may communicate omissions from the published schema via the Current Configuration object if applicable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service-details">Service Details</h2>
<h3 id="eventing">Eventing</h3>
<p>This section covers the REST-based mechanism for subscribing to and receiving event messages.</p>
<p>The Redfish service requires a client or administrator to create subscriptions to receive events. A subscription is created when an administrator sends an HTTP POST message to the URI of the subscription resource. This request includes the URI where an event-receiver client expects events to be sent, as well as the type of events to be sent.  The Redfish service will then, when an event is triggered within the service, send an event to that URI.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Services shall support &quot;push&quot; style eventing for all resources capable of sending events.</li>
<li>Services shall not &quot;push&quot; events (using HTTP POST) unless an event subscription has been created. Either the client or the service can terminate the event stream at any time by deleting the subscription.  The service may delete a subscription if the number of delivery errors exceeds pre-configured thresholds.</li>
<li>Services shall respond to a successful subscription with HTTP status 201 and set the HTTP Location header to the address of a new subscription resource.  Subscriptions are persistent and will remain across event service restarts.</li>
<li>Clients shall terminate a subscription by sending an HTTP DELETE message to the URI of the subscription resource.</li>
<li>Services may terminate a subscription by sending a special &quot;subscription terminated&quot; event as the last message. Future requests to the associated subscription resource will respond with HTTP status 404.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two types of events generated in a Redfish service - life cycle and alert.  </p>
<p>Life cycle events happen when resources are created, modified or destroyed.  Not every modification of a resource will result in an event - this is similar to when ETags are changed and implementations may not send an event for every resource change. For instance, if an event was sent for every Ethernet packet received or every time a sensor changed 1 degree, this could result in more events than fits a scalable interface. This event usually indicates the resource that changed as well as, optionally, any attributes that changed. </p>
<p>Alert events happen when a resource needs to indicate an event of some significance.  This may be either directly or indirectly pertaining to the resource.  This style of event usually adopts a message registry approach similar to extended error handling in that a MessageID will be included.  Examples of this kind of event are when a chassis is opened, button is pushed, cable is unplugged or threshold exceeded.  These events usually do not correspond well to life cycle type events hence they have their own category.</p>
<p>NOTE: Refer to the <a href="#security">Security</a> section for security implications of Eventing</p>
<h4 id="event-message-subscription">Event Message Subscription</h4>
<p>The client locates the eventing service through traversing the Redfish service interface.  When the eventing service has been discovered, clients subscribe to messages by sending a HTTP POST to the URL of the collection for subscriptions in the Eventing Service for which they are requesting events. This should be found off of the root service as described in the schema for that service.  </p>
<p>The specific syntax of the subscription body is found in the Redfish Schema. </p>
<p>On success, the &quot;subscribe&quot; action shall return with HTTP status 201 (CREATED) and the Location header in the response shall contain a URI giving the location of the newly created &quot;subscription&quot; resource. The body of the response, if any, shall contain a representation of the subscription resource. Sending an HTTP GET to the subscription resource shall return the configuration of the subscription. </p>
<h4 id="event-message-objects">Event Message Objects</h4>
<p>Event message objects POSTed to the specified client endpoint shall contain the properties as described in the Redfish Event Schema.</p>
<p>This event message structure supports a message registry.  In a message registry approach there is a message registry that has a list or array of MessageIDs in a well known format.  These MessageIDs are terse in nature and thus they are much smaller than actual messages, making them suitable for embedded environments.  In the registry, there is also a message.  The message itself can have arguments as well as default values for Severity and RecommendedActions.</p>
<p>The MessageID property contents shall be of the form</p>
<p> <em>RegistryName</em>.<em>MajorVersion</em>.<em>MinorVersion</em>.<em>MessageKey</em> </p>
<p>where </p>
<ul>
<li><em>RegistryName</em> is the name of the registry. The registry name shall be Pascal-cased.</li>
<li><em>MajorVersion</em> is a positive integer representing the major version of the registry</li>
<li><em>MinorVersion</em> is a positive integer representing the minor version of the registry </li>
<li><em>MessageKey</em> is a human-readable key into the registry. The message key shall be Pascal-cased and shall not include spaces, periods or special chars.  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="subscription-cleanup">Subscription Cleanup</h4>
<p>To unsubscribe from the messages associated with this subscription, the client or administrator simply sends an HTTP DELETE request to the subscription resource URI.</p>
<p>In order to avoid &quot;orphan&quot; subscriptions (subscriptions not cleaned up by the client, e.g., in the case the client has died or simply forgets to delete a subscription), the event service can be configured to automatically delete subscriptions under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>The service received an error POSTing to the configured event destination URL (client-url  field of the subscription) some service-defined number of consecutive times within a configurable time window.  See the properties defined in the EventService schema for details.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asynchronous-operations">Asynchronous Operations</h3>
<p>Services that support asynchronous operations will implement the Task service &amp; Task resource.</p>
<p>The Task service is used to describe the service that handles tasks.  It contains a collection of zero or more task resources. The Task resource is used to describe a long running operation that is spawned when a request will take longer than a few seconds, such as when a service is instantiated. Clients will poll the URI of the task resource to determine when the operation has completed and if it was successful.</p>
<p>The Task structure in the Redfish Schema contains the exact structure of a Task.  The type of information it contains are start time, end time, task state, task status, response (completion codes) as well as potential links to sub-tasks that were spawned.</p>
<p>Each task has a number of possible states.  The exact states and their semantics are defined in the Task resource of the Redfish Schema.  </p>
<p>When a client issues a request for a long-running operation, the service returns a status of 202 (Accepted). </p>
<p>Any response with a status code of 202 (Accepted) shall include a location header containing the URL of a monitor for the task and may include a wait header to specify the amount of time the client should wait before querying status of the operation. </p>
<p>The response body of a 202 (Accepted) should contain an instance of the Task resource describing the state of the task.</p>
<p>As long as the operation is in process, the service shall continue to return a status code of 202 (Accepted) when querying the status monitor returned in the location header.</p>
<p>Once the operation has completed, the status monitor shall return a status code of OK (200) and include in the body of the response a mime message containing the results of the initial operation, as if it had completed synchronously.</p>
<p>The client can continue to get information about the status by directly querying the Task resource using the <a href="#resource-identifier">resource identifier</a> returned in the body of the 202 (Accepted) response.</p>
<ul>
<li>Services that support asynchronous operations shall implement the Task resource</li>
<li>The response to an asynchronous operation shall return a status code of 202 (Accepted)
and set the HTTP response header &quot;Location&quot; to the URI of a status monitor
associated with the activity. The response may also include a wait header specifying
the amount of time the client should wait before polling for status. The response body 
should contain a representation of the Task resource in the same major media type (e.g. JSON, XML) that would
have been used to return a synchronous response.</li>
<li>GET requests to either the Task monitor or the Task Resource shall return the current status of the operation without blocking.</li>
<li>Operations using HTTP GET, PUT, PATCH should always be synchronous. </li>
<li>Clients shall be prepared to handle both synchronous and asynchronous responses for requests using HTTP DELETE and HTTP POST methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resource-tree-stability">Resource Tree Stability</h3>
<p>The Resource Tree must be consistent on a single service across device reboot and A/C power cycle, and must withstand a reasonable amount of configuration change (e.g. adding an adapter to a server). The resource Tree on one service may not be consistent across instances of devices.  The client must walk the data model and discover resources to interact with them.
It is possible that some resources will remain very stable from system to system (e.g. BMC network settings) -- but it is not an architectural guarantee.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Resource Tree should remain stable across Service restarts and minor device configuration changes</li>
<li>A Resource Tree shall not be expected by the client to be consistent between instances of services</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3>
<p>Automatic discovery of managed devices supporting the Redfish Scalable Platform Management API is accomplished using the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP).  This protocol allows for network-efficient discovery without resorting to ping-sweeps, router table searches, or restrictive DNS naming schemes.  Use of SSDP is optional, and if implemented, shall allow the user to disable the protocol through the &#39;Manager Network Service&#39; resource.  </p>
<p>As the objective of discovery is for cilent software to locate Redfish-compliant managed devices, the primary SSDP functionality incorporated is the M-SEARCH query.  Redfish also follows the SSDP extensions and naming used by UPnP where applicable, such that Redfish-compliant systems can also implement UPnP without conflict.</p>
<h4 id="upnp-compatibility">UPnP Compatibility</h4>
<p>For compatibility with general purpose SSDP client software, primarily UPnP, TCP port 1900 will be used for all SSDP traffic.  It is recommended that devices also respond to M-SEARCH queries for UPnP Root Devices (with NT:upnp:rootdevice), with appropriate descriptors and XML documents.</p>
<h4 id="usn-format">USN Format</h4>
<p>The UUID supplied in the USN field shall equal the UUID returned for the Manager implementing the Redfish service.  If there are multiple / redundant managers, the UUID shall remain static regardless of redundancy failover.  The Unique ID shall be in the canonical UUID format, followed by &#39;::dtmf-org&#39; </p>
<h4 id="m-search-response">M-SEARCH Response</h4>
<p>The managed device must respond to M-SEARCH queries searching for Search Target (ST) of the Redfish Service from clients with the AL pointing to the Redfish service root URI.  Redfish device shall also respond to M-SEARCH queries for Search Target type of &quot;ssdp:all&quot;.</p>
<p>Redfish Service root Search Target (ST):   URN:dmtf-org:service:redfish-rest:1</p>
<p>The URN in the reply shall use a service name of &#39;redfish-rest:&#39; followed by the major version of the Redfish specification.  If the minor version of the Redfish Specification to which the service conforms is a non-zero value, and that version is backwards-compatible with previous minor revisions, then that minor version shall be appended, preceeded with a colon.  For example, a service conforming to a Redfish specification version &quot;1.4&quot; would reply with a service of &quot;redfish-rest:1:4&quot;.</p>
<p>An example response to an M-SEARCH multicast or unicast query shall follow the format shown below.  Fields in brackets are placeholds for device-specific values.  </p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
CACHE-CONTROL:&lt;seconds, at least 1800&gt;
ST:urn:dmtf-org:service:redfish-rest:1
USN:uuid:&lt;UUID of Manager&gt;::urn:dmtf-org:service:rest-rest:1
AL:&lt;URL of Redfish service root&gt;
EXT:
</code></pre><h4 id="notify-alive-and-shutdown-messages">Notify, Alive, and Shutdown messages</h4>
<p>Redfish devices may implement the additional SSDP messages defined by UPnP to announce their availability to software.  This capability, if implemented, must allow the end user to disable the traffic separately from the M-SEARCH response functionality.  This allows users to utilize the discovery functionality with minimal amounts of network traffic generated.  </p>

 TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384    
 TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
</code></pre><p>Additional advantage with using above recommended ciphers is - </p>
<p>&quot;AES-GCM is not only efficient and secure, but hardware implementations can achieve high speeds with low cost and low latency, because the mode can be pipelined.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Redfish Service shall provide login sessions compliant with this specification.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="login-sessions">Login Sessions</h5>
<p>For functionality requiring multiple Redfish operations, a standard Login session is specified.  The URI used for session management is specified in the /redfish resource with the property &quot;SessionService&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
    ...
    &quot;SessionService&quot;: {

}
</code></pre>
<h5 id="login">Login</h5>
<p>A session is created by an HTTP POST to the SessionService/Sessions resource, including the following POST body:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
    &quot;UserName&quot;: &quot;&lt;username&gt;&quot;
    &quot;Password&quot;: &quot;&lt;password&gt;&quot;
