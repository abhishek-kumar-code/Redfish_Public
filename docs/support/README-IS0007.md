These documents are available for public review and comment until superseded.

The following files are part of the Redfish Extensions for FPGAs development effort:

* Processor_v1.xml, ProcessorMetrics_v1.xml, AccelerationFunctionCollection_v1.xml, and AccelerationFunction_v1.xml - Schema definitions for modeling FPGAs
* public-rackmount1 - Mockup containing a Processor found under System "437XR1138R2" called "FPGA1", which also contains ProcessorMetrics and AccelerationFunctions
* RedfishExtensionsForFPGAs.pdf - Presentation describing the Redfish Extensions for FPGAs data model
