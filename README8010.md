# Foreword

The following files are part of the Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API ("Redfish") development effort:

* DSP0226 - Redfish Specification - this file is the main Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API Specification.
* DSP2044 - Redfish Whitepaper - this is intended to be a non-normative document helping those new to Redfish understand how to interact with the Redfish service and understand common functions and tasks.
* DSP2043 - Redfish Mockup - this is a mockup that can be used as sample of output from GETs from A Redfish service.  Informative in nature, it was used to develop the schema.  A person can set up an NGINX or similar server and configure it to output JSON format and then use this directory for demonstration purposes.
* DSP8010 - Redfish Schema - this contains the Redfish Schema definitions.  These files are normative in nature and are normatively reference by the Redfish Specification.  There are two Schema formats - CSDL (OData Common Schema Definition Language format which is in XML) and JSON Schema.  These Schema defintions should be functionally equivalent, thus specifying the schema in two different languages.
