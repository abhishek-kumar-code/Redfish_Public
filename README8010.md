# Foreword

The following files are part of the Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API ("Redfish") development effort

* Specification.md - this files is the main Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API Specification
* Whitepaper.md - this is intended to be a non-normative document helping those new to Redfish understand how to interact with the Redfish service and understand common functions and tasks.
* Readme2043.md - Mockup Readme.
* Readme8010.md - this document.

These other components are part of the Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API development effort
* Mockup (DSP2043) - this is a mockup that can be used as sample of output from GETs from A Redfish service.  Informative in nature, it was used to develop the schema.  A person can set up an NGINX or similar server and configure it to output JSON format and then use this directory for demonstration purposes.
* Schema (DSP8010) - this contains the Redfish Schema definitions.  These files are normative in nature and are normatively reference by the Redfish Specification.  There are two Schema formats - CSDL (OData Common Schema Definition Language format which is in XML) and JSON Schema.  These Schema defintions should be functionally equivalent, thus specifying the schema in two different languages.
